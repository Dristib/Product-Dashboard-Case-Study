# Internal Operations Dashboard – Product Case Study

## Overview
This project is a product management case study focused on defining, scoping, and documenting an internal operations dashboard used by teams to manage users, content, and performance metrics efficiently.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate structured product thinking using an existing open-source system as a realistic foundation.

## Problem Statement
Internal teams often rely on fragmented tools to track users, performance metrics, and operational workflows. This results in:
- Poor visibility into key metrics
- Inefficient decision-making
- Increased operational overhead

## Product Objective
Design a centralized dashboard that enables operations and admin teams to:
- Monitor critical metrics in real time
- Manage users and roles efficiently
- Improve operational visibility and speed

## My Role
**Product Manager (Self-Initiated Case Study)**

- Defined product vision and success criteria
- Identified primary user personas (Ops, Admin, Manager)
- Scoped MVP and prioritized features
- Designed core user workflows and information hierarchy
- Evaluated trade-offs between usability, speed, and scalability
- Used an existing open-source codebase to ground decisions in technical feasibility

## Key Features (MVP)
- Role-based access and permissions
- Admin dashboard with key operational metrics
- User and content management views
- Modular layout supporting future integrations
- Scalable structure for additional analytics and tools

## Success Metrics (Hypothetical)
- Reduction in time to access key operational data
- Improved task completion speed for admin workflows
- Increased adoption across internal teams

## Notes
This project leverages an open-source dashboard template and is adapted as a **product management case study**. The focus is on product definition, prioritization, and decision-making rather than original code authorship.
